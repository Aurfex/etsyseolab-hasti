# Add Product Module Progress Report (2026-02-28)

## Current Status
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Latest commit:** `14bcc20`
- **Latest production deployment:** `https://etsyseolab-6-5qj7ipghi-dariushs-projects-05cb5ba2.vercel.app` (Ready)

## What Was Fixed (Chronological)

### 1) OAuth / login cookie reliability
- Fixed callback cookie handling and modern cookie attributes (`SameSite=None; Secure` where needed).
- Added no-store headers around auth endpoints to reduce stale callback issues.

### 2) Vercel function-limit issue for Add Product
- Consolidated image upload flow into existing `etsy-proxy` path to stay within Hobby function limits.
- Removed extra API endpoint that pushed project over function count.

### 3) Service-worker cache staleness
- Bumped SW cache and improved activation behavior to force fresh UI assets.

### 4) Add Product Step 1 rework (Image-first)
- Step 1 now supports upload + Analyze flow.
- Analyze auto-fills core listing fields (title, description, tags, category hint mapping, price, quantity, maker fields).

### 5) Analyze payload / runtime stability
- Client-side image optimization before Analyze (resize/compress/limit images) to prevent `413 FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`.
- Fixed API handler shape mismatch (`Request` vs `VercelRequest`) causing `500`.

### 6) AI provider path correctness
- Added explicit OpenAI-first generation path using `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Added runtime guards and clearer failure behavior.
- Confirmed successful OpenAI responses with `provider: "openai"` in payload.

### 7) Step 1 UX and data quality improvements
- Improved Analyze button styling and loading state.
- Added heuristic to default `is_supply=false` for finished jewelry-like products.
- Added SEO score card + competitor comparison snapshot in Step 1.
- Added “Apply Suggestions & Re-score” action.

### 8) Reuse existing SEO Optimizer system in Add Product
- Wired Add Product Step 1 and re-score flow to reuse the existing optimizer engine (`runFullOptimization`) for title/description/tags refinement.

### 9) AI output hardening for Add Product
- Tightened prompt and normalization:
  - Plain-text description output (no markdown headings/bullets formatting artifacts).
  - Better Etsy constraints for title/tags.
  - Reduced generic fallback text behavior where AI is available.

## Key Deploy/Commit Trail (recent)
- `430941e` – Added Etsy-friendly SEO score card in Step 1.
- `ffa9e27` – English-only SEO recommendations + Apply Suggestions & Re-score button.
- `4d5db0b` – Reused SEO Optimizer engine for Add Product generation/re-score.
- `14bcc20` – Stricter Add Product AI output (plain-text description + tighter prompt).

## Known Observations
- Earlier fallback output (`"Handmade Jewelry Listing"`, warning about missing AI key) was observed when hitting older deployments/cached routes.
- Current path is deployed on production-ready build above; verify with hard refresh and latest deployment URL if stale behavior appears.

## Latest Update (Variants + CSV Step)
- Added a **new step between AI SEO and Review**:
  - `Variants + Pricing CSV`
- Prefilled variant presets for ring workflow:
  - Sizes: `6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12`
  - Materials: `sterling silver, 14k gold, platinum`
- Added CSV upload/parser for pricing matrix import:
  - Required columns: `size, material, price`
  - Optional columns: `quantity, sku`
  - Validates missing size/material combinations and invalid prices.
- Added Etsy-required fields in the same step:
  - `item_type`, `production_type`
  - `shipping_profile_id`, `return_policy_id`, `processing_profile_id`, `shop_section_id`
  - personalization controls (`enabled`, `optional`, `instructions`, `buyer_limit`)
- Added validation gate: cannot continue to final step without imported pricing rows.
- Preview step now shows imported pricing row count.

### Commit for this update
- `8417d20` – Add Variants + Pricing CSV step to Add Product flow with Etsy required fields.

## Final Resolution (end of session)
The Add Product flow is now confirmed end-to-end working, including Etsy variations.

### Final fixes completed after this report's initial draft
- Added strict validation / defaults for Etsy create listing requirements:
  - `when_made` enum update to `2020_2026`
  - `shipping_profile_id` required path + default prefill for user shop
  - `readiness_state_id` discovery for shop-specific valid value
- Added client-side image compression before upload to prevent Vercel `FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`.
- Ensured publish flow calls inventory sync after listing creation and image upload.
- Reworked variation rebuild logic to avoid deprecated property IDs and use valid Etsy property discovery.
- Fixed taxonomy/listing endpoint path issues causing inventory `404 Resource not found`.

### Confirmed final working result
- Etsy listing creation: ✅
- Image upload: ✅
- Variation creation in Etsy (Size + Material): ✅
- 21 pricing rows applied from CSV matrix: ✅
- User confirmation received: success (`yessssss...`).

### Stable final commit
- `db30aee` on `main` (Add Product + Etsy variation matrix flow)

## Post-final UX fix (Pricing Calculator)
- Resolved input UX bug where typing multi-digit values required re-clicking the field after each character.
- Root cause: immediate numeric coercion on each keystroke.
- Fix: introduced draft text input state and commit-on-blur behavior for calculator fields.
- Result: uninterrupted typing (e.g., entering `234` in one go) with stable focus.
- Commit: `6eb9daa` on `main`.

## Recommended Next Step (if continuing)
1. Add “accept only if score improved” guard for re-score action.
2. Add visible provider badge in UI (`OpenAI` / `Fallback`) for easier debugging.
3. Add optional dry-run validator panel that checks Etsy-required fields before submit.
